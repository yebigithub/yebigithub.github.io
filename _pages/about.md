I am a Ph.D. candidate from [Dr. Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) 's group in the School of Animal Sciences at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://vt.edu/). 

My research interests focus on incorporating statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics into the study of animal and plant genetics in the omics era. 

I am also interested in the application of computer vision systems for high-throughput phenotyping in precision agriculture.

<!-- Before joing VT, I obtained a master degree in Animal Biology at [University of California Davis](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/), a master degree in Animal Nutrition and Feed Science at [Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.caas.cn/), a bachelor degree in Animal Science at [Shandong Agricultural University](http://www.sdau.edu.cn/). -->
