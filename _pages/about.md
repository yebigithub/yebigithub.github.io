I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate from [Dr. Juan Pedro Steibel](https://www.ans.iastate.edu/people/juan-steibel)'s group in the Department of Animal Science at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). 

I earned my Ph.D. under the mentorship of [Dr. Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) in the School of Animal Science at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://vt.edu/).

My research interests focus on incorporating artificial intelligence, computer vision, statistics, phenomics, and genetics to study animal and plant sciences.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
