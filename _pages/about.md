I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate from [Dr. Juan Pedro Steibel](https://www.ans.iastate.edu/people/juan-steibel)'s group in the Department of Animal Science at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). 

I earned my Ph.D. under the mentorship of [Dr. Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) in the School of Animal Science at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://vt.edu/).

My research interests focus on incorporating artificial intelligence, computer vision, statistics, phenomics, and genetics to study animal and plant sciences.
