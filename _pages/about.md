I am a Ph.D. candidate from [Dr. Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/)'s group in the School of Animal Sciences at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://vt.edu/). 

My research interests focus on incorporating artificial intelligence, computer vision, statistics, phenomics, and genetics to study animal and plant sciences.
