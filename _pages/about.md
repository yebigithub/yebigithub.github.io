I recently defended my Ph.D. dissertation from [Dr. Morota's lab](http://morotalab.org/) in the School of Animal Sciences at [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](https://vt.edu/) and expect to graduate in December 2024.

My research interests focus on incorporating artificial intelligence, computer vision, statistics, phenomics, and genetics to study animal and plant sciences.

<!-- Before joing VT, I obtained a master degree in Animal Biology at [University of California Davis](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/), a master degree in Animal Nutrition and Feed Science at [Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.caas.cn/), a bachelor degree in Animal Science at [Shandong Agricultural University](http://www.sdau.edu.cn/). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
