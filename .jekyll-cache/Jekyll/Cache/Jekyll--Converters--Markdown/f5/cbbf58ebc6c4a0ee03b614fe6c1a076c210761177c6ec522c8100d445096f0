<!-- Before joing VT, I obtained a master degree in Animal Biology at [University of California Davis](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/), a master degree in Animal Nutrition and Feed Science at [Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.caas.cn/), a bachelor degree in Animal Science at [Shandong Agricultural University](http://www.sdau.edu.cn/). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
