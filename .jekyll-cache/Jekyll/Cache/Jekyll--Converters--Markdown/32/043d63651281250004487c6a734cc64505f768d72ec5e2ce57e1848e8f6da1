I"Å<p>I am a Ph.D. student from <a href="http://morotalab.org/">Dr. Gota Morota</a> â€˜s group in the School of Animal Sciences at <a href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests focus on incorporating statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics into the study of animal and plant genetics in the omics era.</p>

<p>I am also interested in the application of computer vision systems for high-throughput phenotyping in precision agriculture.</p>

<!-- Before joing VT, I obtained a master degree in Animal Biology at [University of California Davis](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/), a master degree in Animal Nutrition and Feed Science at [Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.caas.cn/), a bachelor degree in Animal Science at [Shandong Agricultural University](http://www.sdau.edu.cn/). -->
